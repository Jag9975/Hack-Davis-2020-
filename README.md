There are so many free resources available online that can help you learn anything you may wish. Still, it can be pretty challenging to find a good programs out of the thousands of options that are available. We created a webpage using Google Custom Search, that lets the user search for the concepts that he/she may be trying to learn. The Custom Search looks for it in the list of hand picked websites that provide the best courses/information for little to no charge.  

# Google Custom Search
Our google custom search looks for the keyword requested by the user in the list of websites under General. If the requested keyword falls under one of the listed categories, he/she may choose that before searching. This allows the google custom search to list results that are more related to the keyword.
